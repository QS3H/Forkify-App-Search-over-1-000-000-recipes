# Forkify Project

A modern recipe application built with JavaScript, Parcel, and SCSS. Forkify allows users to search for recipes, view detailed cooking instructions, bookmark favorites, and upload their own custom recipesâ€”all in a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Search Recipes:** Find recipes from a public API by keyword.
- **Recipe Details:** View ingredients, cooking time, servings, and directions.
- **Adjust Servings:** Dynamically update ingredient quantities based on desired servings.
- **Bookmark Recipes:** Save favorite recipes to revisit later.
- **Upload Recipes:** Add your own recipes to the app.
- **Pagination:** Browse search results with easy navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages and loading spinners.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Parcel (v2) Bundler**
- **SCSS for styling**
- **HTML5**
- **Forkify API**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
   cd Forkify-App
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   $env:TEMP="D:\Portfolio Projects\Course Projects\JavaScript Projects\Forkify-App\.parcel-cache"
   $env:TMP="D:\Portfolio Projects\Course Projects\JavaScript Projects\Forkify-App\.parcel-cache"
   npm run start
   ```
   *(On Windows, set TEMP and TMP as above if your project is not on the C: drive)*

4. **Open the app:**
   Visit [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser.

## What I Learned

- **Modern JavaScript:** Deepened my understanding of ES6+ features, async/await, and modular code organization.
- **MVC Architecture:** Practiced separating concerns using Model-View-Controller principles for scalable, maintainable code.
- **Parcel Bundler:** Learned how to bundle assets, manage static files (like SVG icons), and troubleshoot cross-drive build issues on Windows.
- **API Integration:** Gained experience fetching and handling data from third-party APIs.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error and loading state management for a better user experience.
- **SCSS & Responsive Design:** Improved skills in writing modular, maintainable SCSS and building responsive layouts.
- **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Resolved real-world build and environment issues, especially with Parcel and Windows file systems.
